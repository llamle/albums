## Synopsis

This is my first attempt at building a react-native application. This is primarily an exploratory app to see if I enjoy working in react and in react-native.

## Motivation

I've been interested in developing mobile applications for a while but didn't have enough time to dedicate to learning C or Swift. I've tried Ionic and Cordova and was left unimpressed, but react and react-native are game changers and I'm really starting to enjoy building with it.
  
## Installation

This should be fairly easy to get up and running. Download or clone this repo, then do `npm i` to install the node modules, then `react-native run-ios` and you're good to go.
